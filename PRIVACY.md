# Privacy Policy for See No Numbers

## Overview
See No Numbers is a browser extension designed to hide numbers on websites at the request of the user. We take privacy and security seriously. This document explains what data is collected by See No Numbers, how it is used, and how it is stored.

## Data Collection
- The extension does **not** collect or track personal data. 
- The extension does **not** collect your browsing history or send any data to external servers.
- The only data stored is the extension’s configuration (such as whether the masking feature is enabled per site). This data is stored locally on your device and cannot be accessed by us or any third party.

## Data Usage
- The local configuration data is used solely to determine how the extension behaves on each website (for example, whether to mask numbers or not).
- No data is transmitted, sold, or shared with third parties.

## Permissions
To perform its intended functions, the extension requests the following permissions:
- **Storage:** Used to store user preferences (e.g., whether masking is enabled on a particular site).
- **Tabs:** Used to determine the domain of the current tab in order to apply per-site settings.
- **Host Permissions:** Required to access and modify page content. The extension uses these permissions solely to hide numbers as configured.

The extension does not include or load remote code, nor does it inject or execute any code hosted on external servers.

## Retention of Data
